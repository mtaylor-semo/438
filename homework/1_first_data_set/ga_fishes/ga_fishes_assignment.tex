\textbf{This assignment is due by the start of the next class period.}

All scientific analyses begin with a set of data. Most data sets 
you will use in this course were assembled by a former student
of this course so that you can focus on analysis and interpretation. You 
will assemble a few small data sets to gain some 
experience with this task.

You will assemble part of a presence / absence data matrix for 
the fishes of Georgia, using distribution maps created by 
researchers at the University of Georgia Museum of Natural 
History. The presence/absence matrix shows whether a species is 
present in a watershed~(1) or absent from the watershed~(0). 
Below is a partial example matrix.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
& Watershed 1 & Watershed 2 & Watershed 3 & \ldots{} & Watershed
X\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Species 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & \ldots{} & 0\tabularnewline
Species 2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \ldots{} & 1\tabularnewline
Species 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots{} & 1\tabularnewline
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} &
\ldots{}\tabularnewline
Species X & 1 & 1 & 0 & \ldots{} & 0\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

You will be given a short list of fishes. For each species, you 
will determine whether it is present or absent in a given 
watershed. A watershed includes all or parts of a large river and 
its tributaries. I will assemble the data obtained by each 
student into a single data set of all of the fishes that 
you will analyze later.

Follow these instructions carefully to complete this
exercise.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Obtain your list of fishes in class.
\item
  Download two files from
  http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/\textasciitilde{}goby/biogeo/

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Georgia\_Fishes.xlsx
  \item
    Georgia\_Watersheds.pdf
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The watersheds map (see last page of this assignment) gives 
  the names of the watersheds. It also has a thick black line 
  that represents the fall line. The fall line is an important 
  biogeographic feature in North America that you will learn 
  more about later. (Unless, of course, you choose to go learn 
  about it now.)
\item
  Change the name of the spreadsheet to Georgia\_Fishes\_Lastname.xls.
  Use \emph{your} last name.
\item
  Type the scientific names of your list of species into the first
  column of the spreadsheet, one species per cell. Be certain to 
  type the names down the column and not across in the same row. 
  Type only the scientific names.
\item
  Go to the Fishes of Georgia website at http://fishesofgeorgia.uga.edu
\item
  Click on the ``Fish List'' link near the top of the page.
\item
  Scroll down until you find your fishes. Your list of fishes is
  arranged with the same order as the list of fishes on the 
  website. As soon as you find the first species on your list, 
  continue sequentially until you complete your list. Do not skip 
  any species on your list.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
The website did include invasive (exotic) species, which I deleted
before creating your lists. Make sure that you are only getting
distribution information for the species on your list and not 
others that may be intermingled on the website. These instances 
are few.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item
  Click on the scientific name of your first species to bring up 
  the species information. You will see a distribution map on the 
  lower right of the web page. The green shading on the map 
  represents the generalized area where the species' presence has 
  been documented.
\item
  For each watershed with green shading, change the 0 in the 
  spreadsheet to 1 to indicate the presence of the species.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
The fall line (the thick black line) on the map you downloaded 
divides some of the watersheds into upper and lower parts. Be 
sure to pay close attention to the location of this dividing fall 
line because it is not drawn on the maps from the website. For a 
species that occurs in both the upper and lower watersheds, be 
sure to change both 0s to 1s in the spreadsheet.

If a species is widespread in one part of a watershed (for 
example, the upper part) and just barely extend into the other 
part (e.g., lower), you can treat the species as present in only 
the widespread part. As an example, see \emph{Cyprinella xaenura} 
under Cyprinidae. The range of this species includes the upper 
Ocmulgee Watershed. In the Ocmulgee, its range extends down to 
and perhaps slightly past the fall line. You would treat this 
species as present in the upper but not the lower Ocmulgee 
watershed. If you are in doubt, don't hesitate to contact me.
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item
  Repeat steps 9 and 10 for each species on your list.
\item
  Upload the completed spreadsheet into the drop box available 
  from the course website.
\end{enumerate}
