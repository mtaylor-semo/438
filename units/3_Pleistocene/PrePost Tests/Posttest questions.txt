Explain why uplifted areas in eastern North America, such the Ozark Plateau or the Eastern Highlands (Appalachian Mountains) tend to harbor higher levels of diversity than more northern or southern regions.


Describe how the Berengian and Southern refugia contributed to speciation and distribution of of some modern taxa during glacial expansion.


The parsimony network below shows the distribution of genetic variation for a species of marine snail along the west coast of North America. Use figure 9.12 (pg. 331) of your text and the information provided by the network to explain whether the distribution of genetic variation is consistent with Pleistocene glacial expansion and contraction for this snail.
