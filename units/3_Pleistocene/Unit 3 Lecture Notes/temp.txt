The Pleistocene is characterized by as many as 20 glacial advances and retreats but only four or five were major advances that extended far down into the northern hemisphere.  Most glacial ice sheets were found in the northern hemisphere because most land surface area is north of the equator. In the southern hemisphere, glaciers were mostly restricted to high elevations at high latitudes, such as the Andes Mountains. Back in the northern hemisphere, the distribution of glacial ice was uneven.  As much as 80% of glacial ice was found in North America although Eurasia did experience considerable glaciation.  As a result, the effects of glaciation in North America has been intensively studied.

The Wisconsin Ice Sheet (Fig. \ref{fig:wisconsinicesheet}), on average, extended down to about 45$^{\circ} latitude (just inside the U.S.), but extended as far south as the present Ohio River valley in the eastern U.S.  Collectively, the southern extent of the major ice sheets is marked by the Missouri and Ohio rivers. These glaciers shaped the terrain and aquatic features of North America.

 The influence of the glaciers, in terms of temperate and climate changes  extended much further south.

Collectively, the advance of the glaciers shaped the North American terrain. 

The Great Lakes are direct results of Pleistocene glaciation, as are many other smaller lakes in northern North America.
