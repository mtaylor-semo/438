\thispagestyle{plain}

\textbf{Save copies of your graphs today as you will need them for the
writing assignment.}

Now that you understand Rapoport's Rule, you'll do a brief exercise to explore whether the
rules apply to primary freshwater fishes in the U.S., plus parts of
northern Mexico and southern Canada. First, you'll calculate the mean
and maximum species richness per degree of latitude and plot that
against latitude. Then, you'll determine whether species range size
increases with higher latitude.

\subsection*{Species Richness}

The geographic area was divided into a grid of 1° latitude $\times$ 1°
longitude cells (see figure below). If a species was collected in one of
the 1° cells, then presence was recorded with a 1. Absence was recorded
with a 0. The presence/absence data for each cell was recorded for 529
species of North American freshwater fishes.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{na_grid}
\end{center}

On one line, enter the following:

\begin{verbatim}
nagrid <- read.csv('http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/~goby/biogeo/nagrid.csv', 
  row.names=1)
\end{verbatim}
\texttt{nagrid} \qquad \# View the data set.

The file is a grid of latitude (rows) by longitude (columns). Each
number greater than zero is the number of species, or \emph{species
richness}, that was collected from that 1° grid cell.

To test Rapoport's rule for species richness, you must compare mean and
maximum species richness to degrees of latitude. You will calculate the
mean and maximum values using the \textbf{apply()} function. The apply
function applies any function, here the \textbf{mean()} and
\textbf{max()} functions, to each row or column of your data set.

\texttt{meansp \textless{}- apply(nagrid,1,mean)}

\texttt{maxsp \textless{}- apply(nagrid,1,max)}

Before you can plot the results, you need to create a latitude axis that
runs from 24 to 49. In the past I've had you use the \textbf{seq()}
function. Here is another way, as long as you want default increments of
1.

\texttt{lat \textless{}- 24:49}  \qquad \# lat \textless{}- seq(24,49,1) does the same thing.

\texttt{lat} \qquad \# view the results

Finally, create your plots. You'll plot two graphs side by side.
As before, I'll give you the basic framework for the \textbf{plot()} function,
then let you \texttt{source} a file of commands to make it pretty.

\texttt{op \textless{}- par(mfrow=c(1,2))} 

\texttt{plot(lat\textasciitilde{}meansp)}

\texttt{plot(lat\textasciitilde{}maxsp)}

\texttt{par(op)}

With the plot window still open, bring the console to the front and enter:

\texttt{source('http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/\textasciitilde{}goby/biogeo/rapo\_pretty.r')}

Save your graph as a PDF or PNG file and upload to the Rapoport drop box.
You \emph{must} do this.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item At what latitudes, approximately, are mean and maximum species richness the
highest? 

	\vspace{3\baselineskip}

	\item Does species richness follow Rapoport's Rule? Explain.

	\vspace{7\baselineskip}
	%\newpage

	\item Why do you think species richness is relatively low between
24–28°N compared to between 30–38°N? A map should be on screen to help
you think about this.

\vspace{7\baselineskip}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Range Size}

You need a different data set to evaluate Rapoport's Rule for range size and latitude. 
Type the following command on one line.

\begin{verbatim}
fishArea <- read.csv('http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/~goby/biogeo/fish_area.csv',
  row.names=1)
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{fishArea} \qquad \# view the data file

Latitude (\textbf{lat}) is one column in the data set. Area
(\textbf{area}) is another column in the data set. Plot a quality
graph using this code (on one line):

\begin{verbatim}
plot(fishArea$lat ~ fishArea$area, xlab = 'Area', ylab = 'Latitude (degrees N)',
  main='Relative Area Occupied by U.S Freshwater Fishes')
\end{verbatim}

Save your graph as a PDF file on your flash drive or upload it to the
Rapoport drop box for safekeeping. You are \emph{not required} to upload
this file to the drop box.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Based on this graph, do the data support Rapoport's rule for
range size and latitude? Explain.

\vspace{7\baselineskip}
\end{enumerate}

Next, create a graph that displays the results in a different way, using what
I call a “champaign graph.” This graph uses ``bubbles'' to plot the
relative area occupied by each species, overlaid on a map of the U.S.,
complete with state boundaries and major rivers.  The center of each bubble
is located at the mean latitude and longitude for each species.

To save typing, I've written all the code for you (you're welcome), which you can run at once by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
source('http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/~goby/biogeo/rapo_champaign.r')
\end{verbatim}

Zoom this graph to full size and save it as a PDF file on your flash
drive or upload it to the Rapoport drop box for safekeeping. You are
\emph{not required} to upload this file to the drop box. Then, answer
the following questions. (Kinda try to ignore the circles located in the
oceans. The algorithm I wrote is rather poor but it serves our needs.)

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Based on this graph, combined with the previous graph, do
U.S. freshwater fishes follow Rapoport's Rule for geographic range size?
Explain.

	\vspace{9\baselineskip}

	\item Considering the geographic ranges east of the Rocky
Mountains, what region of the U.S. seems to have most of the
smaller bubbles? Why do you think this is?

	\vspace{9\baselineskip}

	\item What geographic region west of the Rocky Mountains seems to
have the fewest bubbles? (Or, most of the smallest bubbles?) Why do you think this is? 
\end{enumerate}
