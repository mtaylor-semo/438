\begin{document}
\maketitle
\thispagestyle{plain}
Temperature and precipitation are the two climate variables that most
influence the distribution of ecosystems. This is a fundamental
biogeographic concept which you will explore using a climate data set
taken from Alberta, Canada. The data set contains mean annual
temperature (MAT, in °C) and mean annual precipitation (MAP, in mm) from
80 weather stations spread across eight different ecosystems (Ecosys,
labeled A-H in the data set). For each ecosystem, the dominant plant species or group
was recorded (Cw = Western Redcedar, Gr = mixed grasses, La = Subalpine
Larch). The measurements are in five-year intervals from 1965--2010.

You must recreate, as close as reasonably possible, the following figure
(color version on screen).

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{tutorial_assignment_climate}
\end{center}

Pay attention to the use of colors and symbols. Colors identify the
ecosystems, while the symbols represent the dominant plant groups.

R provides the \texttt{read.csv()} function to read data sets from Internet 
URLs. You will use this function  to get data sets for exercises during this
course. You assign the data to a variable name, as you did in the tutorial
You should assign the data to an informative variable name. To get the 
data for this assignment, type the following command into R:

\texttt{climate \textless{}-
read.csv('http://mtaylor4.semo.edu/\textasciitilde{}goby/biogeo/climatedata.csv')}

\textit{Important}: Use the \texttt{main} argument in the \texttt{plot()} function to add
a main title, which will appear above the graph (but is not shown
above). The title should contain your name and your partner's name.

\subsection*{Some hints:}

Don't forget to use \texttt{attach()} and \texttt{detach()} functions.

Add only one argument at a time to the plot, as you
did in the R Tutorial. If you make an error, it will be easier to find and fix
before adding the next argument. Be careful with quotes and parentheses.

Use \texttt{xlim} and \texttt{ylim} arguments in the \texttt{plot()} function to set the lower and
upper values for the X and Y-axes, respectively. Type \texttt{?plot} to learn about
the \texttt{xlim} and \texttt{ylim} arguments.

You will need eight colors, one for each ecosystem. Instead of defining
eight colors, use \texttt{rainbow(8)} to define your colors. See \texttt{?rainbow} for
details.

Use 21, 22 and 25 to specify the symbols for the \texttt{pch} argument in the
\texttt{plot} function.

Use the \texttt{text()} function to place the names of the major plant groups
into the figure. You will need to use the \texttt{text()} function
three separate times, one for each dominant plant group. Use the \texttt{font=3}
argument to specify italics for the labels. Remember that the first two
numbers should be the X and Y coordinates for your text. The Y value may
be negative for one of the dominant plant group labels.

Technically, you should include °C in the Y-axis label but doing so is
more complex than I want to get into now. However, to encourage
exploration, I will add 50\% extra credit to this assignment (5 pts) if
you figure it out. You may access the Internet to do a Google search.

\subsection*{Upload the completed graph to the tutorial drop box.}

Save the file as a PDF or 75\% jpg file (File menu \textgreater{} Save
as\ldots{}).

Give the file an obvious name like climate\_lastnames.pdf (or .jpg).
Include both last names. You and your partner must \textbf{each upload a
copy} to the drop box in your respective Moodle accounts.
