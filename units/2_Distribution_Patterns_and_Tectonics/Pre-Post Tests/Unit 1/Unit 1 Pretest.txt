Globally, the terrestrial environment is divided into a number of regions, also called realms.  List as many regions as you can.



Briefly explain how these regions were determined.




To the best of your ability, define endemism.  At what scale (local, regional, continental, global, all scales, etc) does endemism apply?




What is the name of the theory that describes how the continents (land masses) move across the surface of the globe.





Explain the proposed model (the mechanism) that explains how the continents move.  In other words, explain the theory that you named above.



Imagine an organism that has a strict Gondwanan distribution.  List two continents where you can find this organism.  List two continents where you will not find this organism.
