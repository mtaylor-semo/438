\begin{document}

Read carefully the papers listed below and then type your answers to the following questions.
Type the question number and then your answer. You do not need to retype the question. Hand-written
assignments will not be accepted. You must have your completed answers
with you in class or your assignment will be considered late. Assignments e-mailed to me after the \emph{start} of class will be
considered late. \emph{Interpret} what you read; do not copy answers directly from the text (that would
be plagiarism). Be prepared to discuss your answers in small groups and as a class. Failure
to discuss these questions may result in a pop quiz with a point value
equal to this assignment.

\textbf{Failure to attend} \textbf{class} \textbf{on the due date} will
result in an automatic 50\% deduction.

\textbf{Cladogenesis:} evolution of new species via branching of lineages into new lineages. A single ancestral species evolves into two descendant species.

\textbf{Anagensis:} evolution of new species within a single lineage. A single ancestral species evolves into a single descendant species.

\begin{questions}
\question[5]
Briefly compare and contrast the three hypotheses proposed by Weigelt.

\ifprintanswers{\bfseries%
H\textsubscript{1}: Current climate and island physical features will be the best predictors of current island diversity.\smallskip

H\textsubscript{2}: Islands that had the greatest change in island area ($\Delta$area) between the \textsc{lgm} and present will have the greatest number (raw and proportion) of endemic species.\smallskip

H\textsubscript{3}: Island that had the greatest change in island isolation ($\Delta$isolation) between the \textsc{lgm} and present will have the greatest number of native, non-endemic species.

\question[5]
Why should islands with high $\Delta$area have high richness for native \emph{and} 
endemic species? Why should islands with $\Delta$isolation have only high native 
richness but low endemic richness. 

\ifprintanswers{\bfseries%
Larger islands, if isolated, can promote speciation. This may be especially true if a larger island gets divided into several smaller islands, as this contributes to allopatric divergence. However, even larger islands can provide opportunities for allopatric separation.

Large changes in isolation means islands that are isolated now were much closer together during the \textsc{lgm}. That would increase gene flow, decreasing the opportunity for speciation to occur.

\question[5]
Weigelt states, “Effects of area change via sea-level change on endemism were strong.” 
Describe the information displayed by Figure 3 and how the figure supports their statement. (Most items of relative importance should be self-explanatory but “No. of entities” is the number of individual islands that formed an \textsc{lgm} island group, a measure of connectivity during the \textsc{lgm}.)

\question[5]
Valente found higher rates of colonization on the Canary Islands compared to other Macaronesian archipelagos. Is this a surprising result? Which effect (target or rescue) applies? Why? Is this result consistent or contrary with glacial changes in sea levels? Explain.

\question[5]
Weigelt studied flowering plants. Valente studied non-migratory birds. What types of biological differences (e.g., ecological, genetical) between flowering plants and birds might explain why plants showed much higher levels of within-island cladogenesis (speciation) than did birds? Be imaginative but biologically sound.

\question[5]
Valente concluded that non-migratory bird assemblages on the archipelago's of Macaronesia are in equilibrium. 
Is there evidence from Weigelt's study to suggest or refute a hypothesis that angiosperm diversity is also at equilibrium? Explain.
